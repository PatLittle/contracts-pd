## Purpose of This Work

The purpose of this work is to set up and deploy a GitHub Pages site with all pictures, fonts, favicons, JSON, and CSV data sources working. This includes automating the deployment process using GitHub Actions, capturing snapshots of the website using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, and ensuring all pages in English and French are stored in the Wayback Machine. Additionally, screenshots of important pages have been captured and added to this README to showcase the work.
